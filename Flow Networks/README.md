# Maximum Flow Estimation 

An optimization problem in graph theory that involves finding the maximum amount of flow of substance (liquid, information) that can be passed through a network. 
In the max flow problem, we have a directed graph with the give source node _s_ and a sink node _t_, and each edge has a capacity that represents the maximum amount
of flow that can be sent through it. The goal is to find the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from _s_ to _t_ while considering the capacity constraints of the edges. 


The jupyter notebook explains various algorithms that help achieve these problems.

2. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm.
3. Dicen Algorithm
